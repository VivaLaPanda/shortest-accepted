# Compiling

To compile this package for your native system, run `go build`.
For ease of use, `go run` will build and run.


# Testing
The program describes its usage on start, and any manual testing
should happen there.
You can run unit tests via `go test -v ./...`.

# Contributing
PRs welcome (though I don't know why you would?)
